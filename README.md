## Description

This project serves as a comprehensive XML manipulation and analysis tool capable of handling various operations on XML files. It provides solutions for basic consistency checks and advanced network analysis.

## Features

### Level 1

1. **Input XML File Location Specification GUI**
   - Allows users to specify the location of an input XML file through a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

2. **XML Consistency Checking**
   - Detects inconsistencies such as missing opening/closing tags or mismatched tags.
   - Provides a visual representation of detected errors.
   - Offers error resolution functionality.

3. **XML Formatting (Prettifying)**
   - Ensures well-formatted XML by maintaining indentation for each level.

4. **XML to JSON Conversion**
   - Converts XML files to JSON format, facilitating compatibility with JavaScript-based tools and libraries.

5. **XML File Minification**
   - Reduces file size by eliminating unnecessary spaces and newlines.

6. **Data Compression**
   - Implements a proprietary compression method to reduce XML/JSON file sizes.

7. **Data Decompression**
   - Restores compressed data to its original format.

### Level 2

1. **Graph Representation of User Data**
   - Utilizes a graph data structure to represent user data from XML files, particularly in social network scenarios (e.g., posts, followers).
   - Defines relationships between users (followers) within the network as a graph for efficient network analysis.

2. **Network Analysis**
   - Derives significant insights from the network representation:
     - Identifies the most influential user (highest number of followers).
     - Determines the most active user (connected to numerous users).
     - Finds mutual followers between any two users.

## Usage

- **Basic Operations:** Users can perform basic XML file manipulations, error detection, and resolution using the intuitive GUI.
- **Advanced Analysis:** Leverage the graph representation for in-depth network analysis, extracting valuable insights about user influence, activity, and relationships within the network.

## Dependencies

- The project may require specific libraries or frameworks for GUI development, XML parsing, graph representation, and compression techniques.

## Instructions

- **Installation:** Detailed instructions for setting up the project, including dependencies and environment setup.
- **Usage Guide:** Clear guidelines on using the GUI, executing various operations, and interpreting the analysis results.

## Contribution Guidelines

- Information on how other developers can contribute to the project, including guidelines for code contributions, bug reporting, and feature requests.

## Future Enhancements

- A roadmap or ideas for future improvements or additional functionalities for the tool.
